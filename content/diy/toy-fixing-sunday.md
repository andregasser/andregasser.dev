Toys break very often in our house. So, from time to time, I get the chance to fix some of them. This time, the customer to get a surgery was a Fisher Price phone that had a water incident.

Today is toy fixing sunday. Fixed that Fisher Price phone (loud speaker was damaged due to water incident). Works like a charm (again). #Fixit #toys #hacking #electronics ðŸ˜‚
