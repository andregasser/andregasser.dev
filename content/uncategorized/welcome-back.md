summary: Welcome on my new personal blog! After a long break, I am back in the business again :-) I'll try to post quality content here for the next couple of years for you to read. I will be mostly covering topics such as information security, software engineering, game development and DIY. Yes, this is a quite diverse range of topics, but this is what interests me most. Be prepared! :-)

Welcome on my new personal blog! Finally, after a long time, I made up my mind and kicked off my new blog. I will focus on topics that I love most. Actually, the range of topics is quite diverse. On the one hand, there will be IT-related articles (especially information security and software engineering), but as well articles on other tech topics like game development (yes, I am a hobbyist game developer) and DIY (do it yourself) stuff. From time to time, there might also be some weird articles maybe, so bear with me! :smile:

I hope you will enjoy reading this blog and find something you can learn for yourself. If you want to contact me, the easiest way is probably Twitter or LinkedIn. Just send me a DM.
