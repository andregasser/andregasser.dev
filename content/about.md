Hello, I am André!

I am a software engineer and Infosec enthusiast working in Zürich, Switzerland. I studied Information and Communication Technologies at HSR Rapperswil and I hold a Master’s Degree in that Area. In my free time, I love to spend time with my family or try to learn new software engineering stuff. If there is still some time left, I work on some DIY maker projects. I have started writing this kind of blog to share some thoughts with you. I hope that some of them will be of certain help someday. If not, I hope you had at least some fun reading my articles and posts.

Please notice, that this blog is entirely personal and the content does not reflect the views and opinions of my employer.
