Hello!

Welcome to my blog where I post stuff about topics that keep me busy during the day. I run this blog in the hope that the content will help other people like you, but also to document interesting topics for myself as a reference.

I live in [Zürich, Switzerland](https://www.google.ch/maps/place/Z%C3%BCrich "Zürich, Switzerland") together with my family. We have two kids and three cats (!). meoow!

During my day job, I spend most of the time writing code in either **Java** or **Kotlin**, combined with **Spring Framework**. I also dedicate a lot of my time to **Information Security**, or **Cyber Security**, as it is called nowadays. Personally, I think, Software Engineering and Information Security are key skills to master these days. So, I'll do my best :smile:

Off the job, I love to spend time with my family. Besides that, when the kids finally fell asleep, I usually work on one of my many, many side projects. I have to admit, that this list is still growing from day to day. Yay!

Please note that this blog is entirely personal and the content does not reflect the views and opinions of my employer.

Cheers!\
André
